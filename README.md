# Wind power direction parametrization

Fit wind speed data to various models: fourier, GP radial basis function, GP periodic kernel.

Uses a Gaussian process kernel with period [0..2pi].

### Goal
Check if fourier series gives similar model as periodic Gaussian process.

For details, see `wind_power_direction.py`.
